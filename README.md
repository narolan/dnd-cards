Welcome to DnD Cards!
The purpose of this application is to provide you spells, monsters and maybe more to come. You can either view those in the application or save them to a PDF to be printed out.

Currently, all the info is stored locally. We enable manual syncing by import/export available on the homepage.

## Demo

This application is available under [dnd-cards](https://narolan.github.io/dnd-cards/)
